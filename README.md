Purpose

This repository serves as a practical submission workspace for the DN4.0 Java FSE learning program.  
It is designed to:

- Document weekly hands-on assignments.
- Apply concepts from modules such as design patterns, data structures, Spring Boot, REST APIs, microservices, etc.
- Track personal progress and reinforce learning through implementation.

Each submission reflects learning from the self-paced modules and SME-led sessions.

Technologies Used

- Java 17+
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton, etc.)
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Maven (in future weeks)
- Spring Boot (in future weeks)

How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Samarth-Chourey/DN-Java-FSE-Solutions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired week and module folder:
   ```bash
   cd 'Week 1/Algorithms_Data_Structures/E_Commerce_Platform_Search'
   ```
3. Compile and run the `Main.java` file:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   ```

Ensure Java 17+ is installed and configured properly in your system.
